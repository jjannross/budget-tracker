# budget-tracker
Budget Tracker is an app that gives users a fast and easy way to track their money, including the ability to access that information at any time regardless of internet connection.   The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When transactions are entered, they should populate the total when brought back online. When the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit, then it will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.  Budget tracker is a progressive web-based application that utilizes server-side compression, web manifest, a service worker, static asset and data caching as well as Mongo DB.
